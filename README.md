<h1>Port Scanner</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
A port scanner is a software application designed to check open ports on a serverâ€™s IP address or hostname. Security and IT specialists use an open port scanner tool to check how security policies are implemented and make accurate recommendations to reduce risk. Malicious hackers also rely on public port scanners to discover exposed and outdated network services they can exploit to gain unauthorized access to a target. This port scanner will be able to scan ports in the range of 1 to 5000 to cover common ports such as;
    21 - FTP (File Transfer Protocol),
    22 - SSH (Secure Shell),
    23 - Telnet,
    25 - SMTP (Mail),
    80 - HTTP (Web),
    110 - POP3 (Mail),
    143 - IMAP (Mail),
    443 - HTTPS (Secure Web),
    445 - SMB (Microsoft File Sharing),
    3389 - RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol).
